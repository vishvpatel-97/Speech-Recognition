# Real time Speech-Recognition to search & play youtube video.

**Speech recognition** is the capability of the computer system to decipher spoken words and phrases and transcribe it into text. Also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT).

## Motivation:

This entire project is made with the purpose of understanding concepts of **Speech Recognition**.

## About Project:

- A user can give a voice command in his/her computer's microphone, so that the Speech Recognition API can understand that speech. 
- The voice command captured will then trigger a web based query in web browser to open youtube.com search page automatically and search for a particular video based on keyword a user has uttered. 
- After that it will select one video from the youtube page automatically thereby playing it in VLC media player available on your computer. 
- In a nutshell, not only youtube.com will be opened in a separate web browser automatically but also a video will be search on youtube and played in a media player automatically based on voice command given.
